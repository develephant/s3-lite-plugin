Create a new bucket on Amazon S3. Make sure the AWS user has the proper S3 permissions.

Replace the AWS_KEY, AWS_SECRET, and S3_BUCKET_NAME placeholders in the main.lua with the proper values based on the AWS account.

Run the project, tap the buttons (includes 2 files for each file operation in the assets directory).

Note: After uploading objects, make sure to clear out your Corona "Documents" sandbox directory to confirm the download actions.
