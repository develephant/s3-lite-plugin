Secure File Transfers with Amazon S3

Hi,

I've just released a new plugin that allows developers of Corona apps and games to securly transfer files using the Amazon Simple Storage Service ([url=https://aws.amazon.com/s3]Amazon S3[/url]).

The [url=https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/plugin/s3-lite][b]S3 Lite[/b][/url] plugin is available in the [url=https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/plugin/s3-lite]Corona Marketplace[/url] with a new release special of [b]20% off through Sunday[/b].
